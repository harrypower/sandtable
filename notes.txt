  - playing with the idea of not even using the cgi stuff and just processing the get response directly in my own socket server.
  - need to play with threads in socket server to break up tasks to do
  - need to come up with a parsing method really simple but yet basic to be secure from obvious stuff
  - more thought on draying letters.. basic idea is to use a linked list for each ascii letter to impliment then
  the link will have another level of linked lists for all the move commands to make the letter.   Also will need words to implement this letter drawing
  maybe make it an object but not really any reason do to that other then encapsulating all the stuff in bit.
