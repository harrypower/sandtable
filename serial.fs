\ Requires:
\
\	stringobj.fs
\	syscalls386.fs
\
\ Revisions:
\

\	3-13-2000  first working version
\	6-03-2001  modified serial_open to disable XON/XOFF flow control,
\			added bit constants for c_iflag, etc.,
\			modified serial_setparams for readability  KM
\      12-13-2001  modified serial_open to disable CR to NL translation.  KM
\       9-17-2004  ported from kForth  KM
\ 11-06-2018 Philip K. Smith removed strings.fs and added stringobj.fs dependancy
\            also added gpl3 license
