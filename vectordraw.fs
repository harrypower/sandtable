\ patterns for drawing on sandtable

\ Requires:
\ on Gforth
\ sandmotorapi.fs
\ on win32forth
\ sandmotorapi.f

\ Revisions:
\ 04/17/2020 started coding

: gforthtest ( -- nflag ) \ nflag is false if gforth is not running.  nflag is true if gforth is running
  c" gforth" find swap drop false = if false else true then ;
gforthtest true = [if]
  require sandmotorapi.fs
[else]
  needs sandmotorapi.f
[then]

: drawvector ( nx ny nangle ndistance -- nx1 ny1 nflag ) \ starting at nx ny location draw a line ndistance long nangles from 3 oclock as 0 angle
\ nflag is 200 if drawing took place and nx1 ny1 are valid current drawing locations
\ nflag is 201 if drawing had some error and nx1 and ny1 are not valid current drawing locations
  0 0 { nx ny nangle ndistance nx1 ny1 }
  ndistance nangle (calc-na) to nx1
  ndistance nangle (calc-nb) to ny1
  nx1 nx + to nx1
  ny1 ny + to ny1
  nx ny nx1 ny1 drawline
  nx1 swap ny1 swap ;
